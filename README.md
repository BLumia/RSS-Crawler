# RSS-Crawler

This is just a simple helper RSS converter for personal use.

This is not a clawer which should be run in scheduling. It works without cron. And it's not design to crawl and store data to local.

Let me tell you a story. I'm (currently) a Windows Phone user, since sooooo many developer doesn't want to and have no plan to make app for WP device, I can only use webapp for alternative.

But EDGE borrower sucks. (always can't display correct.) At most times i just want to read some news feed. I can't stand this any more!

Then i found some good RSS feed reader app. So i write these stuff help me generate RSS feed to let the reader use.

I'll use my script until i got a new android phone or iOS phone.

# RSS 爬行者

其实就是个帮我生成RSS给我的RSS阅读器用的php脚本

这玩意儿不需要计划任务定期跑的，压根没打算定期跑并且塞到数据库或者本地存储什么的。请求一次当即生成（所以会慢一些）。

讲个笑话，关于我为什么要写这么个玩意儿的：我现在是WinPhone用户...

于是我得自力更生满足我看资讯订阅的需求，直到我换手机为止...

# 协议 ?
